# Hi 👋, I'm Srijan Mishra

### A passionate Computer Science Engineer & Machine Learning enthusiast from India

## 🚀 About Me

* 🌱 I’m currently learning **Reinforcement Learning, advanced Deep Learning techniques, and full-stack web development (React + Django)**.
* 💡 I love building **ML models, automation tools, and full-stack apps** that solve practical problems.
* 👯 I’m open to collaborating on **open-source ML, RL and full-stack projects** — especially anything that combines research with production-ready code.
* 📫 How to reach me: **[srijanm89@gmail.com](mailto:srijanm89@gmail.com)**  or connect on LinkedIn.
* ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy turning research ideas into small reproducible projects — I’ve implemented reinforcement learning agents and classical ML pipelines for real datasets.

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 **Human-vs-AI (Reinforcement Learning)**

Trained a reinforcement learning agent to solve a custom environment and packaged the training scripts and model checkpoints. The project includes reproducible training code, evaluation notebooks, and a short report summarizing experiments and hyperparameter choices.
⭐ Tech: *Python, PyTorch, RLlib (or custom training loop)*
📂 Repo: `<link-to-repo>`

### 🔹 **Spam Classifier**

A complete NLP pipeline — data cleaning, feature extraction, model training (Naive Bayes + baseline neural model), evaluation, and deployment notes. Includes cross-validation and an explanation of feature importance.
⭐ Tech: *Python, scikit-learn, pandas*
📂 Repo: `<link-to-repo>`

### 🔹 **Portfolio / Profile Website**

Single-file and React versions of my personal portfolio that showcase projects, CV and contact links. Designed to be minimal, responsive and easy to customize. Perfect for GitHub Pages.
⭐ Tech: *HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React)*
📂 Repo: `<link-to-repo>`

> *Tip:* For each project add a short demo GIF, direct link to the live demo (if any), and a `README.md` in the project repo covering how to run experiments and reproduce results.

### Quick customization checklist (do this once)

* Replace `srijan@example.com` and `<your-github-username>` / `<your-linkedin>` with your real values.
* Replace each `<link-to-repo>` with the real repo URL and add demo GIFs/screenshots for the featured projects.
* Optionally add a short education or certifications section if you want to showcase academics.



* Insert your **actual GitHub username and email** into this README and return a ready-to-paste file.
* Convert this into a **profile README** with badges, a resume link, and demo GIFs added automatically (if you paste the exact project links).
